# DeepAgents MCP template

This template scaffolds a DeepAgents application around a strict MCP Tools
boundary. It includes local calculator MCP servers over stdio and Streamable
HTTP, model-free smoke coverage, a streamed React UI, and an AgentSeek lifecycle
specification.

## Architecture

The generated application keeps four responsibilities separate:

- `.mcp.json` declares the MCP servers and transport settings.
- `config.py` validates the complete file before interpolating environment values.
- `mcp_tools.py` discovers every server and adds stable server-name prefixes.
- `agent.py` builds and caches one DeepAgents graph for the process lifetime.

The frontend renders streamed messages, tool calls, results, and errors. It is a
chat client, not a browser-based MCP configuration editor.

### Connection contract

The `mcpServers` object must contain at least one server. Server names may use
letters, numbers, `_`, and `-`. They become the prefix for exposed tool names.

A `stdio` server has this shape:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "calculator": {
      "transport": "stdio",
      "command": "${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_deepagent.calculator_server"],
      "env": {"SERVICE_TOKEN": "${SERVICE_TOKEN}"}
    }
  }
}
```

A Streamable HTTP server uses the adapter's `http` transport value:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "billing": {
      "transport": "http",
      "url": "${BILLING_MCP_URL}",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${BILLING_MCP_TOKEN}"}
    }
  }
}
```

The generated default config declares `calculator` over stdio and
`calculator_http` at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/mcp`. Its AgentSeek lifecycle starts
the HTTP server and checks `http://127.0.0.1:8765/health`.

`${ENV_VAR}` references are interpolated in commands, arguments, environment
values, URLs, and headers. Every reference must resolve.
`${PYTHON_EXECUTABLE}` is reserved and always resolves to the current Python
interpreter. An environment variable named `PYTHON_EXECUTABLE` cannot override
it.

Configuration and discovery are all-or-nothing. Every configured server must
connect and expose at least one tool. If any server fails or returns no tools,
graph creation fails without a partial tool set. `tool_name_prefix=True`
exposes tools as `<server>_<tool>`, such as `calculator_add`,
`calculator_http_multiply`, or `billing_charge_card`. Final names must be unique and cannot replace the
enabled DeepAgents built-ins: `write_todos`, `ls`, `read_file`, `write_file`,
`edit_file`, `glob`, `grep`, or `execute`. The `task` tool is disabled by this
template's harness profile and is not reserved.

The graph is cached after the first successful build. Restart the AgentSeek
development processes after changing `.mcp.json`, model settings, or server
credentials. MCP tool calls are stateless and do not retain persistent MCP
client sessions between calls.

## Adapt the template

This template pins DeepAgents to `0.6.12` because the enabled built-in tool set
and harness profile APIs are characterized for that exact runtime. Before
upgrading DeepAgents, rerun and update the real built-in collision
characterization, reserved-name set, and profile regressions together.

The smoke task starts or reuses the local HTTP server, checks the complete
discovered tool-name tuple, and performs a real calculator invocation through
both stdio and Streamable HTTP. It stops the HTTP server when it started that
process itself. Adding, removing, or replacing any server changes the complete
discovered tool-name tuple, so update the calculator smoke contract at the same
time.

Set `AGENTSEEK_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `AGENTSEEK_MODEL` for the DeepAgents graph.
`DEEPAGENTS_MODEL` and `BUB_MODEL` are model-name compatibility aliases.
`AGENTSEEK_MODEL_API_KEY` is the lifecycle credential and is passed explicitly
to the selected provider adapter. Provider-native API keys remain direct-runtime
fallbacks; they do not satisfy `agentseek doctor`. Optional custom endpoints
continue to use the provider-native variables in `.env.example`. Optional
LangSmith tracing uses `LANGSMITH_TRACING`, `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`, and
`LANGSMITH_PROJECT`.

All three development processes bind to loopback by default. `LANGGRAPH_HOST`
controls LangGraph from the launching shell. `FRONTEND_HOST` controls Vite from
that shell or `frontend/.env`. The calculator HTTP server remains loopback-only.
Do not add these controls to the root `.env`; it is reserved for application,
model, MCP, and tracing settings.

The frontend derives `http://<browser-host>:2024` by default. For an HTTPS
frontend or a reverse proxy that changes the backend's public scheme, port, or
path, set `VITE_LANGGRAPH_API_URL` in `frontend/.env` to the public LangGraph
API URL. Keep MCP URLs, headers, and credentials out of Vite variables.

This v1 template exposes MCP Tools only. It does not expose MCP Resources or
Prompts, persistent MCP client sessions, interceptors, OAuth helpers, or a
browser-based MCP configuration editor.

## Security boundary

Treat every configured `stdio` command as trusted local code execution. Review
the executable, arguments, working environment, and package source before use.

Keep secrets in the process environment or the untracked `.env` file and
reference them from `.mcp.json` with `${ENV_VAR}`. The root `.env` file is loaded
by both `agentseek task mcp-smoke` and `agentseek dev`, while exported process
values take precedence. Never put secret literals in tracked `.mcp.json`,
commits, logs, error messages, shell output, or shared output, and never echo
them. Do not rely on the template to redact arbitrary MCP tool error content.

For Streamable HTTP, the template validates configuration shape and absolute
`http` or `https` URLs. TLS, network ACLs, and authentication or OAuth must be
enforced at the MCP server, gateway, or deployment boundary. This template does
not create that boundary.

MCP tool descriptions and annotations do not authorize calls. Enforce
authorization in the tool service. For explicit DeepAgents human-in-the-loop
policy, use the final prefixed tool name, for example:

```python
interrupt_on={
    "billing_charge_card": {"allowed_decisions": ["approve", "reject"]},
}
```

This example does not enable automatic HITL. An application contributor must add
and test the policy when assembling the graph.
